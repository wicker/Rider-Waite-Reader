    'focus_relationships': "This is an opportunity to set logic aside and allow actions to be guided by feelings alone. Irrational? Perhaps. But in certain matters, logic does not apply. Be romantic. Be spiritual. This moment is a chance to see romance as an expression of spirituality, and vice-versa.",
    'focus_work': "How fulfilling is your work? If you're going through the motions, this card challenges you to get back in touch with what delights you. Find a way to integrate your labor with your dreams. If you're already fulfilled, watch for an opportunity to take your satisfaction to the next level.",
    'focus_spirituality': "On rare occasions, Heaven opens, and the Hand of God offers us the opportunity to experience unexpected spiritual highs. Pay close attention to the events around you; one is a seedÑan opportunity to be uniquely and totally immersed in the work and power of Spirit.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "How comfortable are you with expressions of emotion? Of faith? This card challenges you to be more open with both. A centered person freely shares what he or she feels, and a truly spiritual person can share his or her faith in natural, non-aggressive ways. Give both a try.",
    'focus_fortunetelling': "Romance is in the cards! A new relationship or marriage is just around the corner. Prayers are answered."

    'focus_relationships': "In a healthy relationship, everyone involved feels safe enough to reveal how he or she really feels. Feeling attraction? Say so. Not invested? Say so. Reflected love is a balm for the soul, but hidden or repressed emotions will poison a relationship.",
    'focus_work': "Meet your goals more easily by recruiting others who see things your way. If what you're doing now doesn't thrill you, admit it. Do what delights you, or engineer a change of heart that allows you to enjoy what you're doing now.",
    'focus_spirituality': "The idea that your spiritual practice must satisfy anyone other than yourself is an illusion. Do what you feel drawn to do. Find support and solace with like-minded individuals. Forgive spiritual abuse and rediscover the power of unity.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "Rather than merely reflect the desires of others, identify what you want and be yourself. You can appreciate others without sacrificing your individuality. Honesty is power; be brave enough to admit what you really feel.",

    'focus_relationships': "Be open to unconventional relationships that defy your dearly-held expectations. Saying what you feel may not be enough; sometimes, actions speak louder than words. Think beyond sex. What service can you render as a way of showing your love?",
    'focus_work': "For insight into what you really love to do, monitor how you spend your time. We make time for what delights us. If your schedule is dominated by things you don't love doing, it's time to realign your priorities. Ask others how they manage their time.",
    'focus_spirituality': "Especially when walking a solitary path, it's easy to neglect the rituals that are an integral part of living with Spirit. Become a part of a like-minded group. Celebrate the season. Seek outward, shared expressions of your inner faith.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "To have more friends, be one. Look for opportunities to serve others or aid them in their pursuits. Shared success is sweeter, and you'll find your own success is multiplied when you're helping others achieve their goals, too.",

    'focus_work': "Bored? It's time to ask for new challenges. When work fails to fulfill us, it quickly becomes drudgery. There's always plenty to do. You can shatter inertia by just getting started. Take that first step; others will follow.",
    'focus_spirituality': "Unless you tap into a fresh reservoir, your spiritual well will eventually run dry. Replenish your Spirit with a dip into new experiences: meditation, drumming, fasting. Open yourself to new possibilities.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "Boredom and ingratitude blind us to new opportunities. Don't fall into this trap! Alter your routine. Try new foods. Dress in different colors. Break the mold, and you'll never stop growing.",

    'focus_work': "You can't look back. The good old days have given way to the here and now, and it's time to adjust your efforts accordingly. If you made mistakes, admit them, pick up the pieces, and return to work with renewed effort. Don't focus on losses; define new goals.",
    'focus_spirituality': "Your faith, at first, may seem like cold comfort in times of loss. But if you accept that all things unfold according to a larger pattern, you must look for the role this loss plays in the grand scheme of things. Three cups remain upright. What do you still have to be thankful for?",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "Perspective is everything. Each of us is predisposed to focus on the positive or the negative; if you tend toward the latter, condition yourself to be more optimistic by reviewing how apparently dark events of the past gave rise to greater strength or insight.",
    'focus_fortunetelling': "A breakup looms. Don't cry over spilt milk. Take your lumps and get back in the saddle."

    'focus_relationships': "We like to say relationships involve give and take; this card invites you to focus on giving more than receiving. Watch for opportunities to take on chores that neither you nor your friends (or partners) enjoy. Surprise a loved one with an unexpected, unmerited gift.",
    'focus_work': "Most people focus on profit; what might happen if you focused on giving instead? A gift given with strings attached deserves a skeptical response. When charitable gestures are revealed (or perceived) as bribes, don't expect good results.",
    'focus_spirituality': "Few things energize the weary spirit like service. Volunteer. Lend a helping hand to someone in need. Give of your time, your money, and your talentsÑall three. In helping others, you help yourself.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "When you can give something without expecting anything in return, you've reached an important milestone. Accelerate your quest for maturity; practice giving with no thought of what's in it for you.",

    'focus_relationships': "Comparing your friendships and relationships to unrealistic, Hollywood-produced fantasies is a sure-fire formula for disappointment. Rather than imagine what things ought to be, face how things are...and then take the steps necessary to make your relationships more rewarding.",
    'focus_work': "Plan for contingencies. At the same time, don't allow what might be to distract you from what is. Unless it's your job to build castles in the sky, be sure to invest more effort in hard work than sweet dreams.",
    'focus_spirituality': "Use meditation and prayer to build a clear vision of your spiritual goals, and call on this for inspiration in times of need. Pay attention to dreams; they have important messages for you.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "Your imagination is a powerful tool, capable of shaping your experience and your world. Focus your thoughts. See life as it should be, and then take personal responsibility for making your dreams come true. Always link imagination with action!",

    'focus_relationships': "If a relationship fails to supply what you need, consider looking elsewhere. Occasionally, a little time apart can restore perspective and reveal true character. Don't be afraid to be alone; it's okay to be your own person.",
    'focus_work': "Threatening to quit is never productive. Dedicate yourself wholeheartedly to a task...or move on without fanfare. A persistent feeling that something's missing should tell you something. Know when to say No! to overbearing bosses.",
    'focus_spirituality': "Consider the value a retreat might offer. Spend time alone in nature. By stepping outside of your daily routine, you automatically heighten your awareness. When you return to your every day world, you'll see it with fresh eyes.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "As children, we ridicule quitters. As adults, we need to realize the time does come to throw in the towel. In your own life, what habits or attitudes need to be abandoned, cold turkey? Don't think of it as quitting; see quitting as a step toward a new beginning.",
    'focus_fortunetelling': "Someone's stepping out on you, now or in the near future. Maybe it's time to quit talking about the problem and just move on."

    'focus_relationships': "Appreciate what you have. When things are good, it's easy to take someone for granted. Today, emphasize the ways your friendships and relationships are working for you. What's working? What's comforting? What do you have to smile about?",
    'focus_work': "Who should your work satisfy? What are the criteria used to evaluate your work's completeness? Knowing the answer to these questions is the key to success. Resist the urge to revise and revise; know when to be happy with your best effort.",
    'focus_spirituality': "Finding your centerÑa still point, a place of peace insulated from outer disturbancesÑwill help you maintain an enlightened perspective. When pressured or rushed, remember to breathe. Pause, retreat, withdraw. Allow your spiritual discipline to yield practical results. ",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "A life of constant luxury breeds dullness. Learn when to push back; you can be satisfied with less than you think. With a little restraint in place, you'll be better equipped to enjoy real luxury when the time for indulgence comes.",
    'focus_fortunetelling': "Whatever you want, you'll get it."

    'focus_work': "Fulfilling work is rare indeed. Be careful how you define success; don't get so caught up in reaching the next goal that you forget to celebrate your achievements so far. Feeling overwhelmed? Take time out to count your blessings and realign your work with what matters most.",
    'focus_spirituality': "While we may glimpse nirvana in meditation, maintaining a constant state of bliss may prove to be an unrealistic goal. Delight in the small steps you take along the Path. Don't be overly concerned with spiritual arrival; enjoy the journey.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "Gratitude enhances success. While celebrating your achievements, remember to give credit to those who helped you achieve it. Overwhelm others with sincere recognition, and you'll find yourself surrounded by an army of eager supporters.",
    'focus_fortunetelling': "Marriage and family are in the cards. Expect a friendship to blossom into a romance."

    'focus_work': "Beware initiatives designed to do little more than stir everyone's emotions. Keep your own feelings in check, and don't hesitate to ask for details. Decisions may require more than the facts. What do your wisest advisors feel about your options?",
    'focus_spirituality': "Spirituality may incorporate extremes (speaking in tongues, intense rituals), but more modest spiritual experiences are also valid. Strive to find Spirit in everyday actions. When you do, the smallest gestures take on the aura of ministry.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "Temper your inclination to be driven to extremes. Love can be passionate without overwhelming you. Spirituality can be deep without becoming bizarre. In all things, seek the balance of the middle ground.",

    'shadow': "Becoming so caught up in matters of Spirit, you become detached from the world. Allowing empathy to disable you (instead of inspire action). Using psychic abilities to wield covert influence. Wallowing in emotionalism, sentiment, or self-pity.",
    'focus_relationships': "No amount of hand-wringing or self-pity will make things better. Stop second-guessing yourself! Strong feelings should tell you something, not render you helpless. Reflect on what you really need, then take action; otherwise, you'll get bogged down.",
    'focus_work': "Strong emotions in the workplace can distract people from their everyday goals. (Many may welcome such distraction!) Rather than get caught up in all the agony and ecstasy, keep an even keel. Don't fret; trust your intuition and take appropriate action.",
    'focus_spirituality': "In truth, very few of us were meant for a life of constant contemplation. Most of us have to live in the real world! If you possess psychic abilities, be sure their deployment is regulated by your highest ethical standards. ",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "Beating yourself up accomplishes nothing. Embracing your true feelings is one thing; wallowing in them is another. Pause to feel...and then move on, informed and enabled by your insights.",

    'focus_spirituality': "A deeper sense of Spirit should move us to greater service. Let wisdom guide you to a ministry that makes sense in terms of your life and your world. Consider taking on the role of a counselor or mentor. Use your experiences to help others mature.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "The time has come to assume a leadership role, using your experiences to guide others. Find a way to give back some of what you've been given. You have more wisdom than you know; draw on newfound maturity to come to the aid of a cause greater than yourself.",

    'focus_work': "Cut through emotionalism and get to the facts. In this situation, the devil's in the details. What happened and when? Slay some sacred cows, stop the blame game, and get down to brass tacks. What are the objectives? Where are you in relationship to your goals?",
    'focus_spirituality': "Your relationship with Spirit should inform all your decisions. Here's an opportunity to apply what you've learned in your inner life to decisions that impact your outer life. If you were to make this decision for someone else, what verdict would you render?",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "At some point, we must go from seeking advice to making our own decisions. Gather information, draw on the experience of mentors, and get the facts...but be prepared, as a mature individual, to make decisions and own the consequences.",

    'focus_work': "Consider all the facts before making your decision. Once you've made your decision, be prepared to defend it with well-reasoned arguments. If others continue to reject your counsel, be aware that you may have to let go, sit back, and let time prove that you were right, after all.",
    'focus_spirituality': "Spiritual maturity demands we see ourselves as we really areÑand love ourselves in spite of our shortcomings. Rather than debate whether or not you're good enough, be thankful for the progress you've made thus far. Avoid beating yourself up with high-minded standards of perfection.",

Don't allow rejection to deliver a fatal blow; you've lots to offer those who can appreciate it. It's okay to mourn the loss of a friend or loverÑbut don't let mourning become a way of avoiding further growth and new experiences.",
    'focus_work': "You may find yourself playing the role of the lone wolf; for now, that's okay. Things don't always turn out as planned. Rather than pull out your hair, retrace your steps and identify objectively what went wrong. This information will come in handy in the future.",
    'focus_spirituality': "In the midst of heartbreak, it's not always possible to sit back and ask, 'What lesson does Spirit have for me in this situation?' Give yourself time to move past emotional responses; once you do, you can think in terms of what an event might teach you.",
    'focus_personalgrowth': "If at first you don't succeed, try again. It's an old cliche, but an important mantra for anyone determined to make the most of what he or she has been given. If recent efforts have fallen short, you must make a choice: despair...or embody the spirit of determination.",
